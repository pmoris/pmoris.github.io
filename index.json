However the generic case of evaluating all possible TCR-epitope pairs remains challenging, mainly due to the high diversity of sequences and the limited amount of currently available training data. In this work, we present a novel feature engineering approach for sequence-based predictive molecular interaction models, and demonstrate its potential in generic TCR-epitope recognition. The approach is based on the pairwise combination of the physicochemical properties of the individual amino acids in both sequences. By providing a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a combined representation of the sequences, the model is primed to learn from the molecular binding context directly. It forgoes the need of separate feature extraction steps that operate on, and have to be learned for, both interactors independently. We found indications that this simplifies the prediction task and that it can improve the generalization capabilities of the model to a certain degree. We postulate that similar feature engineering methods could pave the way towards general epitope-agnostic models, although further improvements and additional data are still necessary. Note that this representation is generic and could be applied to a wide variety of similar prediction tasks where sequence-based inputs are the norm. In addition, we highlight that appropriate validation strategies are required to accurately assess the generalization performance of TCR-epitope recognition models when applied to both known and novel epitopes.","tags":null,"title":"Treating biomolecular interaction as an image classification problem – a case study on T-cell receptor-epitope recognition prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sofie Gielis","**Pieter Moris**","Wout Bittremieux","Nicolas De Neuter","Benson Ogunjimi","Kris Laukens","Pieter Meysman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"3615a64bc8acdee594706025e1214b27","permalink":"https://pmoris.github.io/publication/gielis-detection-enriched-cell-2019/","publishdate":"2020-01-25T15:21:49.923254Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gielis-detection-enriched-cell-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Detection of enriched T cell epitope specificity in full T cell receptor sequence repertoires","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" MILES is a Java tool to discover subgraphs (or network motifs) in a graph (or network) that are significantly associated with a given set of vertices (or nodes) of interest.

Here we present MILES (MIning Labeled Enriched Subgraphs), a Java-based subgraph mining tool for discovering motifs that are associated to a given set of nodes of interest, such as a list of genes or proteins, in biomolecular networks. It provides a unique extension to the widely used enrichment analysis methodologies by integrating network structure and functional annotations in order to discern novel biological subgraphs which are enriched in the targets of interest. The tool can handle various types of input data, including (un)directed, (un)connected and multi-label networks, and is thus compatible with most types of biomolecular networks.   Availability and implementation MILES is available as a platform-independent Java application at https://github.com/pmoris/miles-subgraph-miner alongside a user manual, example datasets and the source code.   Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","tags":null,"title":"MILES: a Java tool to extract node-specific enriched subgraphs in biomolecular networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nele Boon","Moustapha Mbow","Linda Paredis","**Pieter Moris**","Ibrahima Sy","Tim Maes","Bonnie L.
