Status A brief overview of the current status of the project:\n The GeoSentinel network encompasses 71 sites in 29 countries. We plan to enroll 33 sites in the initial phase of the project. So far, 15 ethical approvals and MTAs have been completed, with others in various stages of completion. 63 samples have been collected in total so far, with about half of them being (whole-genome) sequenced already.  As sample collection and processing becomes more systematic, we plan to release up to data genetic variant and epidemiological data every 1-3 months on the SUMMIT data platform.\nAbstract Despite wide-scale control and elimination efforts, the global decline in malaria has stagnated in recent years. There is a strong need for malaria molecular surveillance in endemic regions to address the threats posed by antimalarial drug and diagnostic resistance, and to strategically prioritise the limited resources for malaria control programs. Meanwhile, non-endemic regions are not only being faced with an increasing number of travel-related malaria cases, in conjunction with adverse clinical outcomes, but also with rare cases of autochthonous transmission.\nTo address these issues, we present the SUrveillance of Molecular epidemiology of Malaria In Travelers (SUMMIT) project. Travelers present an as of yet untapped resource of diverse genomic information on the Plasmodium parasite, which allows for close-to-real-time data collection and sharing, as well as the standardization of lab and bioinformatics methodologies.\nWe aim to establish a pioneering platform for the routine systematic surveillance of travel-related malaria, which combines parasite whole-genome sequencing data with epidemiological patient data. The platform will be enabled through a global network of travel clinics ( GeoSentinel ), embrace FAIR data sharing principles and be supported by open and reproducible bioinformatics analysis and reporting pipelines (built using Nextflow and powered by nf-core\u0026rsquo;s components and best practices).\nWe will leverage this continuously growing and global-spanning resource to monitor the emergence and spread of clinically-relevant markers, develop machine learning tools to trace parasite origins and conduct studies on treatment failure. Our approach is complementary to existing surveillance approaches and strives to increase the geographic, temporal and genetic resolution of the available genomic data and function as a sentinel system to aid preparedness efforts for reactive and coordinated responses to outbreaks. Our ultimate goal is to provide an up-to-date and accessible resource containing actionable data that can facilitate further malaria research, inform case management, prioritise efficacy studies and aid in surveillance and control efforts.\nContact us For further information, please reach out to myself , to ITM\u0026rsquo;s PI Prof. Anna Rosanas-Urgell or to GeoSentinel\u0026rsquo;s PI Ralph Huits.\nAcknowledgements This project is carried out jointly by GeoSentinel (and its various affiliated sites) and the Malariology Unit of the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp , and is funded by GeoSentinel, a Cooperative Agreement (1 U01 CK000632-04) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM) that also receives funding from the GeoSentinel Foundation and the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n","date":1722470400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733741378,"objectID":"4eb6ef6b645f41bbf93405c0f07884dc","permalink":"https://pmoris.github.io/project/summit/","publishdate":"2024-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/summit/","section":"project","summary":"A GeoSentinel-ITM project for surveilling the genomic epidemiology of malaria in travelers.","tags":["bioinformatics","malaria molecular surveillance"],"title":"SUMMIT","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Course notes for the Bioinformatics Module of the Fighting Malaria Across Borders (FiMAB) international training programme, created by the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) in Antwerp (Belgium) and supported by VLIR-UOS, as part of a capacity building program for the implementation of sequencing assays for malaria molecular surveillance.\nThe course can be accessed at the following URL: https://pmoris.github.io/FiMAB-bioinformatics/ .\n","date":1714521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724580059,"objectID":"b151cee1aa3c7007d89106b45fc8dd1c","permalink":"https://pmoris.github.io/project/wgs-course/","publishdate":"2024-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/wgs-course/","section":"project","summary":"Course notes offering an introduction to (l)unix and the bioinformatics analysis of sequencing assays for malaria molecular surveillance.","tags":["bioinformatics","educational"],"title":"Introduction to unix and sequencing pipelines","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I contributed a configuration file for the CalcUA HPC (part of the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum ) to the nf-core shared configs .

However, the generic case of evaluating all possible TCR-epitope pairs remains challenging, mainly due to the high diversity of the interacting sequences and the limited amount of currently available training data. In this work, we provide an overview of the current state of this unsolved problem. First, we examine appropriate validation strategies to accurately assess the generalization performance of generic TCR-epitope recognition models when applied to both seen and unseen epitopes. In addition, we present a novel feature representation approach, which we call ImRex (interaction map recognition). This approach is based on the pairwise combination of physicochemical properties of the individual amino acids in the CDR3 and epitope sequences, which provides a convolutional neural network with the combined representation of both sequences. Lastly, we highlight various challenges that are specific to TCR-epitope data and that can adversely affect model performance. These include the issue of selecting negative data, the imbalanced epitope distribution of curated TCR-epitope datasets and the potential exchangeability of TCR alpha and beta chains. Our results indicate that while extrapolation to unseen epitopes remains a difficult challenge, ImRex makes this feasible for a subset of epitopes that are not too dissimilar from the training data. We show that appropriate feature engineering methods and rigorous benchmark standards are required to create and validate TCR-epitope predictive models.","tags":null,"title":"Current Challenges for Unseen-Epitope TCR Interaction Prediction and a New Perspective Derived from Image Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sofie Gielis","**Pieter Moris**","Wout Bittremieux","Nicolas De Neuter","Benson Ogunjimi","Kris Laukens","Pieter Meysman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580241259,"objectID":"3615a64bc8acdee594706025e1214b27","permalink":"https://pmoris.github.io/publication/gielis-detection-enriched-cell-2019/","publishdate":"2020-01-25T15:21:49.923254Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gielis-detection-enriched-cell-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Detection of enriched T cell epitope specificity in full T cell receptor sequence repertoires","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" MILES is a Java tool to discover subgraphs (or network motifs) in a graph (or network) that are significantly associated with a given set of vertices (or nodes) of interest.

Here we present MILES (MIning Labeled Enriched Subgraphs), a Java-based subgraph mining tool for discovering motifs that are associated to a given set of nodes of interest, such as a list of genes or proteins, in biomolecular networks. It provides a unique extension to the widely used enrichment analysis methodologies by integrating network structure and functional annotations in order to discern novel biological subgraphs which are enriched in the targets of interest. The tool can handle various types of input data, including (un)directed, (un)connected and multi-label networks, and is thus compatible with most types of biomolecular networks.
