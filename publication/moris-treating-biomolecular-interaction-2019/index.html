    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">The prediction of epitope recognition by T-cell receptors (TCR) has seen much progress in recent years, with several methods now available that can predict TCR-epitope recognition for a given set of epitopes. However the generic case of evaluating all possible TCR-epitope pairs remains challenging, mainly due to the high diversity of sequences and the limited amount of currently available training data. In this work, we present a novel feature engineering approach for sequence-based predictive molecular interaction models, and demonstrate its potential in generic TCR-epitope recognition. The approach is based on the pairwise combination of the physicochemical properties of the individual amino acids in both sequences. By providing a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a combined representation of the sequences, the model is primed to learn from the molecular binding context directly. It forgoes the need of separate feature extraction steps that operate on, and have to be learned for, both interactors independently. We found indications that this simplifies the prediction task and that it can improve the generalization capabilities of the model to a certain degree. We postulate that similar feature engineering methods could pave the way towards general epitope-agnostic models, although further improvements and additional data are still necessary. Note that this representation is generic and could be applied to a wide variety of similar prediction tasks where sequence-based inputs are the norm. In addition, we highlight that appropriate validation strategies are required to accurately assess the generalization performance of TCR-epitope recognition models when applied to both known and novel epitopes.</p>
